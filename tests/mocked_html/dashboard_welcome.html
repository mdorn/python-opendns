<b>c.	Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</b>
<p>If the Submissions or content provider, member or user believes that the Submissions or content that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the Submissions or content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such Submissions or content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the Submissions or content provider, member or user;</li>
<li>Identification of the Submissions or content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Submissions or content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
<li>A statement that the Submissions or content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the Submissions or content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Submissions or content; and</li>
<li>Submissions or content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the Submissions or content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which OpenDNS is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, OpenDNS' may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Submissions or content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Submissions or content provider, member or user, the removed Submissions or content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at OpenDNS' discretion.</p>
