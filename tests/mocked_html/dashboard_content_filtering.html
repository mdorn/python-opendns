Delinquent payments shall bear interest at the rate of one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) incurred by OpenDNS in collecting unpaid or delinquent amounts. OpenDNS reserves the right to suspend the Service (of which it shall provide advance notice, which may be by email) until Customer pays all past due amounts. All fees are non-refundable.</p>


<h3>E.	Term and Termination.</h3>

<p><b>a.	Free Account Holders</b></p>
<p>If Customer has not purchased a paid subscription to the Site and Service, OpenDNS may terminate Customer's access to all or any part of the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If Customer wishes to terminate these Terms of Service or Customer's OpenDNS account (if Customer has one), Customer may simply discontinue using the Service. </p>

<p><b>b.	Deluxe and Enterprise Account Holders</b></p>
<p>OpenDNS may suspend or terminate access to all or any part of the Service to any Customer at any time and terminate these Terms of Service, if: (i) Customer materially violates these Terms of Service; (ii) OpenDNS provides Customer with commercially reasonable notice of this violation (which may be by email to the Notification Email Address); (iii) OpenDNS uses commercially reasonable efforts to discuss and resolve the violation with Customer; and (iv) despite the foregoing, the violation is not resolved to OpenDNS' reasonable satisfaction, then OpenDNS reserves the right to suspend administrative access to the Service, or to particular components of the Service.  If, after all of the foregoing, Customer still has not cured a violation within thirty days of the commencement of a suspension under this Section, then OpenDNS may immediately terminate the Service for cause. If Customer wishes to terminate these Terms of Service or Customer's OpenDNS account (if Customer has one), Customer may simply discontinue using the Service. </p>

<p>All provisions of the Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination shall survive any termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

<h3>G.	Limitation of Liability.</h3>
<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL OPENDNS, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE, THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT OR PRODUCTS ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE SITE AND SERVICE (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), (III) FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF CUSTOMER'S USE OF ANY CONTENT OR SUBMISSIONS POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE AT OR THROUGH THE SITE AND SERVICE.

CUSTOMER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT OPENDNS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SUBMISSIONS OR USER CONDUCT.</p>

<h3>H.	Indemnification.</h3>
<p><b>a.	Free Account Holders, Deluxe Account Holders and Enterprise Account Holders</b></p>
<p>Customer, at its expense, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless OpenDNS, its affiliates and their employees, contractors, officers, directors and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that arise from Customer's (i) use or misuse of the Service that is in violation of the Terms of Service or violates applicable law; (ii) access to the Site, use of the Service, Submissions, in violation of the Terms of Service; or, (iii) the infringement by Customer, or any third party using Customer's account, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. OpenDNS reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by Customer, in which event Customer will assist and cooperate with OpenDNS in asserting any available defenses.</p>

<p><b>b.	Enterprise Account Holders</b></p>
<p>If Customer has purchased a paid Enterprise subscription to the Site and Service from OpenDNS, OpenDNS, at its expense, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer against any losses, costs and damages arising from a claim by a third party against Customer that the Service infringe any United States patent issued as of the Effective Date or misappropriates any protected trade secret; provided that Customer will provide OpenDNS with (i) prompt written notice of the claim, (ii) sole control over the defense or settlement (provided, however, that any such settlement shall not result in financial liability on Customer or require its admission of any fault without its prior written consent), and (iii) reasonable support and cooperation with regard to the defense. In the event that OpenDNS' right to provide the Service is enjoined or in OpenDNS' reasonable opinion is likely to be enjoined, OpenDNS may, at its expense, obtain the right to continue providing the Service, replace or modify the Service so that they become non-infringing but remain functionally equivalent, or if such remedies are not reasonably available, terminate this Contract without liability to Customer.  OpenDNS shall have no indemnification liability under this Indemnification Section or otherwise to the extent a claim or suit is based upon (a) use of the Service in combination with software or hardware not provided by OpenDNS if infringement would have been avoided in the absence of such combination, (b) modifications to the Service not made by OpenDNS, if infringement would have been avoided by the absence of such modifications, (c) use of any version other than a current release of the Service, if infringement would have been avoided by use of a current release.</p>


<h3>I.	International/Non-California Use.</h3>
<p>OpenDNS makes no representation that the Content or Submissions are appropriate or available for use in locations outside of California, and accessing the Service is prohibited from territories where such Content or Submissions are illegal. If Customer accesses the Service from other locations, Customer does so at Customer's own initiative and is responsible for compliance with local laws.</p>

<h3>J.	Dispute Resolution.</h3>
<p>A printed version of these Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Customer and OpenDNS agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>

<p>These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. Customer expressly agrees that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or Customer's use of this Site or Service shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California and Customer further agrees and submits to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action. Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms of Service, including without limitation, this section.</p>

<h3>K.	Integration and Severability</h3>

<p>These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between the Customer and OpenDNS with respect to the Service and use of this Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and OpenDNS with respect to this Site (but excluding the use of any software which may be subject to a separate end-user license agreement). If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>

<h3>L.	Miscellaneous.</h3>
<p>These Terms of Service and the Customer's use of the Site and Service contemplated hereunder are personal to Customer, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Customer except with OpenDNS' prior written consent. OpenDNS may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. All waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under these Terms of Service, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees. All notices under these Terms of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</p>

<h3>N.	Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice.</h3>
<p>OpenDNS has adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf">http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf</a>). The address of OpenDNS' Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement ('Designated Agent') is listed at the end of this policy.</p>

<p>It is OpenDNS' policy to (1) block access to or remove Submissions and content posted by users that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue providing the Service to repeat offenders.</p>

<b>a.	Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:</b>
<p>If Customer believes that Submissions or content residing on or accessible through the Site or Service infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:</p><ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>Identification of works or materials being infringed;</li>

<li>Identification of the Submissions or content that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the Submissions or content that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that OpenDNS is capable of finding and verifying its existence;</li>
<li>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address;</li>
<li>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the Submissions or content is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
<li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>b.	Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent:</b></p>
<p>It is OpenDNS' policy:</p>
<ol>

<li>to remove or disable access to the infringing Submissions or content;</li>

<li>to notify the Submissions or content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the Submissions or content; and</li>
<li>that repeat offenders will have the infringing Submissions or content removed from the system and that OpenDNS will terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the Service.</li>
</ol>
<b>c.	Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</b>
<p>If the Submissions or content provider, member or user believes that the Submissions or content that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the Submissions or content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such Submissions or content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the Submissions or content provider, member or user;</li>
<li>Identification of the Submissions or content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Submissions or content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
<li>A statement that the Submissions or content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the Submissions or content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Submissions or content; and</li>
<li>Submissions or content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the Submissions or content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which OpenDNS is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>

</ol>
<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, OpenDNS' may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Submissions or content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Submissions or content provider, member or user, the removed Submissions or content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at OpenDNS' discretion.</p>
